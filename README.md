# MessageCoder
This project is currently unfinished.

The end goal is for the user to enter a message and click the encrypt/decrypt button.
If the message is new then the message will be scrambled.
If the message is scrambled the message will be decoded.
The encrypting and decrypting will be done based off of a encryption number decided on by both parties.
How the message is sent is to be decided on by both parties and the encryption can be adjusted.
